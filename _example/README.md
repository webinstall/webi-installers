install:

## Cheat Sheet

> `foo` doesn't exist and this text should have been replaced. It doesn't do
> anything, but what it does is useful because it is; everybody knows it.

To run foo:

```bash
foo
```

### Add Baz Highlighting

To run foo with both bar and baz highlighting turned on:

```bash

```

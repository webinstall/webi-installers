### Files

These are the files / directories that are created and/or modified with this
install:

```text
~/.config/envman/PATH.env
~/.local/bin/foo
~/.local/opt/foo
```

## Cheat Sheet

> `foo` doesn't exist and this text should have been replaced. It doesn't do
> anything, but what it does is useful because it is; everybody knows it.

To run foo:

```sh
foo
```

### Add Baz Highlighting

To run foo with both bar and baz highlighting turned on:

```sh
foo --bar=baz
```

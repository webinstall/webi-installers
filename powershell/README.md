  PowerShell Core is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework.

  The core benefit of running `pwsh` on Mac or Linux is that you get a way to debug Windows 10 scripts without having to boot up Windows 10.

  For example, if you want to create a `curl.exe -A "windows" | powershell` script for Windows 10 (as we do), it's helpful to be able to do some level of debugging on other platforms.

<!--
For example, if you wanted to install Node.js with powershell and
webinstall.dev, you can:

```cmd
curl.exe -s -A "MS" https://webinstall.dev/node@lts | powershell
```
-->

<!-- TODO if, pipe, function -->

### Hello World

1. Make and enter your project directory
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ./hello/cmd/hello
   pushd ./hello/
   ```
2. Initialize your `go.mod` to your _git repository_ url:
   ```sh
   go mod init github.com/example/hello
   ```
3. Create a `hello.go`

   ```sh
   cat << EOF >> ./cmd/hello/hello.go
   package main

   import (
     "fmt"
   )

   func main () {
     fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
   }
   EOF
   ```

4. Format, build, and run your `./hello`
   ```sh
   go fmt ./...
   go build -o hello ./cmd/hello/
   ./hello
   ```
   You should see your output:
   ```text
   > Hello, World!
   ```

### How to run a Go program as a service

On Linux:

```sh
# Install serviceman (compatible with systemd)
webi serviceman
```

```sh
# go into your programs 'opt' directory
pushd ./hello/

# swap 'hello' and './hello' for the name of your project and binary
sudo env PATH="$PATH" \
    serviceman add --system --username "$(id -u -n)" --name hello -- \
    ./hello

# Restart the logging service
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```
